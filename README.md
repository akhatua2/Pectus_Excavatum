Pectus excavatum is a condition in which the person's breastbone is sunken into the chest. In severe cases, pectus excavatum can look as if the center of the chest has been scooped out, leaving a deep dent.

The procedure to treat this condition is to insert a metal bar custom designed to the patients ribcage is insertted below the breastbone in order to lift it up. However, due to the specific nature of the treatment, it is very dificult to get the correct shpae and size of the pecture bar which causes a relatively high rate of failure. In this project we create a 3D virtual rendition of this procedure which can be generated for each patient using their CAT scans which would allow doctors to get a better understanding on the patients need before the operation. 

Aditionally we use Machine Leaning and Robotic Path Planning to find the optimal position and path of the bar to be placed inside the patient. 

## Unity files to run this program

Due to the large size of the rendered environment all of the files are avaiable open sourced here:

```

In the procedure the bar can be controlled by the user using mouse or a VR headset. These movements are recorded to collect data for the path planning algorithm. The idea is to make a small incision on the side of the chest. The bar is then curved to the ideal shape of the chesta nd then inserted in the upside fashion. After insertion the bar is flipped in order to push the breastbone up and in the ideal position. In the unity 3D space the bar interacts with the skin of the and can we moved freely.
