# Pectus_Excavatum

Pectus excavatum is a condition in which the person's breastbone is sunken into the chest. In severe cases, pectus excavatum can look as if the center of the chest has been scooped out, leaving a deep dent.

The procedure to treat this condition is to insert a metal bar custom designed to the patients ribcage is insertted below the breastbone in order to lift it up. However, due to the specific nature of the treatment, it is very dificult to get the correct shpae and size of the pecture bar which causes a relatively high rate of failure. In this project we create a 3D virtual rendition of this procedure which can be generated for each patient using their CAT scans which would allow doctors to get a better understanding on the patients need before the operation. 

Aditionally we use Machine Leaning and Robotic Path Planning to find the optimal position and path of the bar to be placed inside the patient.
